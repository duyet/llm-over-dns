./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh

# 2. Make changes
# Edit files...

# 3. Commit
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
# Hooks automatically run quality checks
# Commit succeeds only if all checks pass
```

**Without Git Hooks:**
```bash
# 1. Make changes
# Edit files...

# 2. Run checks
./scripts/pre-commit.sh

# 3. Fix any issues
# Edit files...

# 4. Commit
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
```

**Learn more:** See "Pre-commit Workflow" in QUALITY.md

### CI/CD Workflow (Automated)

**On Push/PR:**
1. GitHub Actions triggers workflows
2. quality.yml: Tests, linting, formatting, docs, security
3. coverage.yml: Coverage analysis, Codecov upload
4. Results shown in PR comments

## Common Tasks

### Before Your First Commit

```bash
# 1. Install tools
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin

# 2. Verify setup
./scripts/pre-commit.sh

# 3. (Optional) Install git hooks
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

### Daily Development

```bash
# Before each commit
./scripts/pre-commit.sh

# If it fails, fix issues and try again
```

### Improving Coverage

```bash
# 1. Generate coverage report
./scripts/test-coverage.sh

# 2. Open HTML report
open coverage/index.html

# 3. Find uncovered lines (shown in red)
# 4. Add tests for those code paths
# 5. Re-run: ./scripts/test-coverage.sh

# 6. Verify coverage improved
```

### Fixing Clippy Warnings

```bash
# 1. See what clippy says
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features

# 2. Try automatic fix
cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty

# 3. Or fix manually
# Edit src/file.rs...

# 4. Verify fix
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
```

### Checking Code Format

```bash
# See what needs fixing
cargo fmt --check

# Fix automatically
cargo fmt

# Verify it's fixed
cargo fmt --check
```

## Troubleshooting

**Scripts won't run:**
```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

**Tests fail:**
```bash
# Update Rust
rustup update

# Clean and rebuild
cargo clean
cargo test
```

**Coverage won't generate:**
```bash
# Install cargo-tarpaulin
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin

# Try again
./scripts/test-coverage.sh
```

**Git hooks not working:**
```bash
# Reinstall
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

**See detailed troubleshooting:** See "Troubleshooting" in QUALITY.md

## Next Steps

1. **Read QUALITY.md** - Understand the quality standards and procedures
2. **Install tools** - `cargo install cargo-tarpaulin`
3. **Try pre-commit** - `./scripts/pre-commit.sh`
4. **Set up hooks** - `./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` (optional)
5. **Enable Codecov** - Visit codecov.io (optional)
6. **Start developing** - Use quality checks in your workflow
