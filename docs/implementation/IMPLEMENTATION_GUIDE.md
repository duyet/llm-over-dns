# Already done, but verify:
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Step 3: Run Quality Checks

```bash
# Option A: Quick pre-commit checks
./scripts/pre-commit.sh

# Option B: Comprehensive audit
./scripts/quality-check.sh

# Option C: Coverage report
./scripts/test-coverage.sh
```

## Detailed Configuration

### Quality Gates

The project enforces six quality gates:

#### 1. Code Coverage (100%)
- **Tool:** cargo-tarpaulin
- **Target:** 100% of lines covered by tests
- **Enforcement:** Automatic in CI/CD
- **Report:** HTML report in `coverage/` directory

#### 2. Testing (100% Pass Rate)
- **Tool:** cargo test
- **Scope:** All unit and integration tests
- **Enforcement:** Pre-commit and CI/CD
- **Command:** `cargo test`

#### 3. Code Linting (Zero Warnings)
- **Tool:** Clippy
- **Policy:** All warnings treated as errors
- **Enforcement:** Pre-commit and CI/CD
- **Command:** `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`

#### 4. Code Formatting (100% Compliance)
- **Tool:** rustfmt
- **Standard:** Rust project conventions
- **Enforcement:** Pre-commit and CI/CD
- **Command:** `cargo fmt --check`

#### 5. Dependency Validation
- **Tool:** cargo check
- **Scope:** All dependencies resolved
- **Enforcement:** Pre-commit and CI/CD
- **Command:** `cargo check --all-targets`

#### 6. Documentation Quality
- **Tool:** cargo doc
- **Requirement:** Public API documented
- **Enforcement:** CI/CD
- **Command:** `cargo doc --no-deps`

### Script Details

#### `scripts/pre-commit.sh`

**Purpose:** Lightweight quality checks before committing

**Checks Performed:**
1. Unit tests pass
2. Clippy has no warnings
3. Code is formatted with rustfmt
4. Dependencies are valid

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/pre-commit.sh
```

**Exit Codes:**
- `0`: All checks passed, safe to commit
- `1`: One or more checks failed, fix issues first

**Output Example:**
```
=== Pre-commit Quality Checks ===

[1/4] Running tests...
✓ All tests passed

[2/4] Running clippy (zero warnings)...
✓ No clippy warnings found

[3/4] Checking code formatting...
✓ Code is properly formatted

[4/4] Checking dependencies...
✓ All dependencies validated

================================
✓ All quality gates passed!
You're good to commit.
```

#### `scripts/test-coverage.sh`

**Purpose:** Generate detailed code coverage reports

**Checks Performed:**
1. Installs cargo-tarpaulin if missing
2. Runs tests with coverage instrumentation
3. Generates HTML report
4. Validates against 100% target

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/test-coverage.sh
# View report: open coverage/index.html
```

**Output:**
- `coverage/index.html`: Interactive HTML report
- Console: Coverage percentage and summary

**Example Output:**
```
=== LLM over DNS - Code Coverage Report ===

Running tests with coverage tracking...

✓ Coverage report generated successfully
Report location: /path/to/coverage/index.html

Overall Coverage: 95.5%
⚠ Coverage is 4.5% below target
```

#### `scripts/quality-check.sh`

**Purpose:** Comprehensive 6-point quality audit

**Checks Performed:**
1. Code Coverage Analysis
2. Unit Tests
3. Clippy Analysis (Zero Warnings)
4. Code Format Check
5. Dependency Audit
6. Documentation Check

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/quality-check.sh
```

**Output:**
- Detailed report with pass/fail for each check
- Warnings summary
- Clear guidance on fixing issues

#### `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`

**Purpose:** Set up automatic pre-commit quality checks

**Hooks Installed:**
1. `pre-commit`: Runs `./scripts/pre-commit.sh`
2. `commit-msg`: Validates conventional commit format
3. `post-merge`: Updates dependencies after merge

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

**Bypass (if needed):**
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

### Coverage Workflow (`.github/workflows/coverage.yml`)

**Triggers:** Push to main/develop, PRs to main

**Jobs:**
1. Generate coverage with tarpaulin
2. Upload to Codecov
3. Comment on PRs with report

**Configuration:**
- Timeout: 120 seconds
- Caching enabled for faster builds
- Codecov API token required

### Quality Workflow (`.github/workflows/quality.yml`)

**Triggers:** Push to main/develop, PRs

**Jobs:**
1. Quality checks (tests, linting, formatting, docs)
2. Security audit with cargo-audit
3. Release build verification

## Codecov Setup

### Enable Coverage Tracking

1. Visit [codecov.io](https://codecov.io)
2. Sign up with GitHub account
3. Add repository
4. Coverage reports auto-generate via CI/CD

### Features
- Coverage graphs and trends
- PR comments with reports
- Coverage badges
- Detailed per-file breakdown
- Commit history tracking
- Target enforcement

### Configuration (`codecov.yml`)

Key settings:
```yaml
coverage:
  project:
    default:
      target: 100        # 100% coverage required
      threshold: 0       # No slack (0% tolerance)
```

## Development Workflow

### With Git Hooks (Recommended)

1. Install hooks (one-time):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
   ```

2. Make changes:
   ```bash
   # Edit files
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add feature"
   # Hooks automatically run quality checks
   # Commit succeeds only if all checks pass
   ```

4. Push:
   ```bash
   git push
   # CI/CD runs full test suite and coverage
   ```

### Without Git Hooks

1. Make changes
2. Run checks:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/pre-commit.sh
   ```
3. Fix any issues
4. Commit and push

## Performance & Caching

### Build Caching

GitHub Actions configured with:
- Cargo registry cache
- Cargo index cache
- Cargo build target cache

**Speed-up:** 2-3x faster builds on subsequent runs

### Local Caching

Pre-commit scripts don't use caching to ensure fresh results.

**Build Speed:**
- First build: 2-3 minutes
- Subsequent: 30-60 seconds
- With cache: 20-30 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Tests won't compile
```bash
# Update Rust
rustup update

# Clean build
cargo clean
cargo build

# Check dependencies
cargo check
```

#### Clippy warnings
```bash
# Update clippy
rustup component add clippy --toolchain stable

# Fix automatically (when possible)
cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty
```

#### Coverage not 100%
```bash
# Generate report
./scripts/test-coverage.sh

# Open HTML report
open coverage/index.html

# Add tests for uncovered lines
# Re-run: ./scripts/test-coverage.sh
```

#### Git hooks not working
```bash
# Reinstall
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh

# Check permissions
ls -la .git/hooks/

# Test manually
.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Quality Metrics Dashboard

### Local Metrics

Run this to see current metrics:
```bash
./scripts/quality-check.sh
```

### CI Metrics

Check GitHub Actions:
1. Go to project repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. View workflow results
4. Check badges in README (if configured)

### Codecov Metrics

View at [codecov.io/gh/owner/llm-over-dns](https://codecov.io):
- Coverage percentage
- Coverage trends
- File-level breakdown
- PR coverage comparison

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily
- Run pre-commit before each commit
- Check pre-commit hook output

### Weekly
- Monitor PR coverage reports
- Address any coverage regressions

### Monthly
- Review Codecov dashboard trends
- Update dependencies: `cargo update`
- Run security audit: `cargo audit`

### Quarterly
- Review quality gate effectiveness
- Analyze coverage trends
- Update quality targets if needed

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Quality Rules

Edit `codecov.yml`:
```yaml
coverage:
  project:
    default:
      target: 100
      threshold: 0  # Adjust as needed
```

### Additional Checks

Add to `scripts/pre-commit.sh`:
```bash
# Custom validation
if ! custom_check; then
    echo "Custom check failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Alternative Hook System

Use `.pre-commit-config.yaml` instead of bash scripts:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Integration Points
