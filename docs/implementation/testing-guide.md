# Quality Assurance & Code Coverage Setup

> **Status:** ✓ Complete and Ready for Use  
> **Setup Date:** October 30, 2025  
> **Coverage Target:** 100%  
> **Quality Gates:** 6 enforced standards

## What This Provides

A production-ready quality assurance infrastructure for the LLM over DNS project with:

- **100% Code Coverage Target** enforced by Codecov
- **Zero-Warning Clippy Policy** for code quality
- **Automated Quality Checks** via scripts and git hooks
- **CI/CD Integration** with GitHub Actions
- **Comprehensive Documentation** for all workflows

## Quick Start (3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Install coverage tool
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin

# 2. Run quality checks
./scripts/pre-commit.sh

# 3. (Optional) Install git hooks for automatic checks
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

That's it! The infrastructure is ready.

## What Was Installed

### Configuration Files (3)

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks configuration
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` - Three GitHub Actions workflows

### Quality Scripts (4)
- `scripts/pre-commit.sh` - Quick pre-commit checks
- `scripts/test-coverage.sh` - Coverage report generation
- `scripts/quality-check.sh` - Comprehensive 6-point audit
- `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` - Git hooks setup

### Documentation (4)
- `QUALITY.md` (8.9 KB) - Complete user guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (10.5 KB) - Technical details
- `QA_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` (7.7 KB) - Quick reference
- `QA_INDEX.md` - Documentation navigation

## Six Quality Gates

| # | Gate | Target | Tool | Enforcement |
|---|------|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Code Coverage | 100% | cargo-tarpaulin | CI/CD |
| 2 | Testing | 100% pass | cargo test | Pre-commit + CI/CD |
| 3 | Linting | Zero warnings | Clippy | Pre-commit + CI/CD |
| 4 | Formatting | 100% | rustfmt | Pre-commit + CI/CD |
| 5 | Dependencies | All valid | cargo check | Pre-commit + CI/CD |
| 6 | Documentation | All public API | cargo doc | CI/CD |

## Daily Workflow

### Option A: With Git Hooks (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Make changes
# Edit files...

# 2. Commit (hooks run automatically)
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
# Quality checks run automatically
# Commit succeeds only if all checks pass
```

### Option B: Manual Checks

```bash
# 1. Make changes
# Edit files...

# 2. Run quality checks
./scripts/pre-commit.sh

# 3. Fix any issues, then commit
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
```

## Available Scripts

### Pre-commit Checks (Recommended)
```bash
./scripts/pre-commit.sh
```
Runs 4 checks: tests, clippy, formatting, dependencies  
Duration: 2-5 minutes

### Coverage Report
```bash
./scripts/test-coverage.sh
# View: open coverage/index.html
```
Generates HTML coverage report with 100% target validation  
Duration: 2-5 minutes

### Comprehensive Audit
```bash
./scripts/quality-check.sh
```
Runs all 6 quality gates with detailed reporting  
Duration: 5-10 minutes

### Install Git Hooks
```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```
One-time setup for automatic pre-commit checks  
Duration: <1 minute

## Codecov Integration

### Enable Coverage Tracking

1. Visit [codecov.io](https://codecov.io)
2. Sign up with GitHub account
3. Add the llm-over-dns repository
4. Coverage reports auto-upload via CI/CD

Features:
- Coverage graphs and trends
- PR comments with detailed reports
- Coverage badges for README
- Per-file and per-commit tracking

## Documentation Navigation

**Need a quick start?**
→ See "Quick Start" section above

**Want to run quality checks?**
→ Use `./scripts/pre-commit.sh`

**Need detailed procedures?**
→ Read `QUALITY.md` (comprehensive guide)

**Looking for technical details?**
→ Read `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

**Want a quick reference?**
→ Read `QA_SETUP_SUMMARY.md`

**Looking for something specific?**
→ Check `QA_INDEX.md` for navigation

**Need troubleshooting help?**
→ See "Troubleshooting" section in `QUALITY.md`

## Common Tasks

### Check Coverage
```bash
./scripts/test-coverage.sh
open coverage/index.html
```

### Fix Clippy Warnings
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty  # Auto-fix
```

### Fix Formatting
```bash
cargo fmt --check  # Check
cargo fmt          # Fix
```

### Run All Quality Checks
```bash
./scripts/quality-check.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Scripts won't run
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Tests fail
```bash
cargo clean
cargo test
```

### Coverage tool missing
```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

### Git hooks not working
```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

For detailed troubleshooting, see `QUALITY.md`.

## CI/CD Automation

GitHub Actions workflows automatically:
- Run tests on every push/PR
- Generate coverage reports
- Upload to Codecov
- Comment on PRs with results
- Enforce all quality gates

No configuration needed - it just works!
