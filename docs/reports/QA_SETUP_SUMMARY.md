# QA & Coverage Setup - Summary

## Setup Complete ✓

This document summarizes the comprehensive quality assurance and code coverage infrastructure that has been configured for the LLM over DNS project.

## What Was Installed

### 1. Configuration Files

#### `codecov.yml`
- **Purpose:** Codecov service configuration
- **Coverage Target:** 100%

### 2. Local Quality Scripts

Four executable shell scripts for local development:

#### `scripts/pre-commit.sh` ✓
Quality checks before committing:

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/pre-commit.sh
```

#### `scripts/test-coverage.sh` ✓
Generates detailed coverage reports:
- ✓ Runs tests with coverage instrumentation
- ✓ Generates HTML coverage report
- ✓ Calculates coverage percentage
- ✓ Validates against 100% target

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/test-coverage.sh
# View: open coverage/index.html
```

#### `scripts/quality-check.sh` ✓
Comprehensive 6-point quality audit:
- ✓ Code Coverage Analysis
- ✓ Unit Tests
- ✓ Clippy Analysis
- ✓ Code Format Check
- ✓ Dependency Audit
- ✓ Documentation Check

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/quality-check.sh
```

#### `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` ✓
Sets up automatic pre-commit checks:
- ✓ pre-commit hook: Runs quality checks
- ✓ commit-msg hook: Validates conventional commits
- ✓ post-merge hook: Updates dependencies

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

### 3. CI/CD Workflows

#### `.github/workflows/quality.yml`
Runs on every push and pull request:
- ✓ Tests
- ✓ Clippy linting
- ✓ Code formatting
- ✓ Documentation generation
- ✓ Security audit
- ✓ Build verification

#### `.github/workflows/coverage.yml`
Runs coverage analysis and uploads to Codecov:
- ✓ Full coverage analysis with cargo-tarpaulin
- ✓ Uploads to Codecov service
- ✓ Comments on PRs with coverage report
- ✓ Caches dependencies for speed

### 4. Documentation

#### `QUALITY.md`
Comprehensive guide covering:
- ✓ Quick start instructions
- ✓ Quality gates and standards
- ✓ Script usage and details
- ✓ CI/CD integration overview
- ✓ Code coverage details
- ✓ Testing best practices
- ✓ Troubleshooting guide
- ✓ Configuration reference

```

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install cargo-tarpaulin for coverage
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

### Step 2: Set Up Git Hooks (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

This will automatically run quality checks before each commit.

### Step 3: Run Quality Checks

Before committing:

```bash
# Quick pre-commit checks
./scripts/pre-commit.sh

# Or comprehensive audit
./scripts/quality-check.sh

# Or coverage analysis
./scripts/test-coverage.sh
```

## Codecov Integration

### Enable Codecov (GitHub)

1. Visit [codecov.io](https://codecov.io)
2. Sign up with GitHub account
3. Activate the repository
4. Coverage reports will be generated automatically via CI/CD

### Features

- ✓ Coverage graphs and trends
- ✓ PR comments with coverage reports
- ✓ Coverage badges
- ✓ Detailed coverage breakdown
- ✓ Commit history tracking
- ✓ Target enforcement

## Pre-commit Workflow

### With Git Hooks (Recommended)

1. Make code changes
2. Run `git commit`
3. Hooks automatically run quality checks
4. Commit succeeds only if all checks pass
5. If needed, bypass with `git commit --no-verify`

### Without Git Hooks

1. Make code changes
2. Run `./scripts/pre-commit.sh`
3. Fix any issues
4. Commit when all checks pass

## CI/CD Automation

### Quality Checks Workflow

Runs on:
- Every push to main/develop
- Every pull request

Checks:
- Tests pass
- No clippy warnings
- Code is formatted
- Docs build correctly
- Security audit passes
- Build succeeds

### Coverage Workflow

Runs on:
- Every push to main/develop
- Every pull request

Features:
- Generates coverage report
- Uploads to Codecov
- Comments on PRs
- Caches dependencies

## Quality Metrics

### Current Standards

| Check | Target | Enforcement |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Code Coverage | 100% | Automatic |
| Test Pass Rate | 100% | Pre-commit + CI |
| Clippy Warnings | 0 | Pre-commit + CI |
| Format Compliance | 100% | Pre-commit + CI |
| Documentation | All public API | CI |
| Security | No vulnerabilities | CI |

## Troubleshooting

### Tests won't compile

Check for missing dependencies:
```bash
cargo check
cargo build
```

### Git hooks not working

Reinstall hooks:
```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

### Coverage not generating

Ensure cargo-tarpaulin is installed:
```bash
cargo install cargo-tarpaulin
```

### Clippy issues

Update Rust:
```bash
rustup update
```

Fix issues:
```bash
cargo clippy --fix
```
