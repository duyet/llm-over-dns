**Built 100% by Claude Code** - From initial concept to production-ready implementation, including CI/CD, Docker, tests, and documentation.

## 🎯 What is this?

Ever wondered if you could query an AI using nothing but DNS? Well, now you can!

LLM over DNS turns your DNS queries into conversations with AI. Ask questions using standard DNS tools, get intelligent answers back as TXT records. It's like having ChatGPT accessible through `dig`.

### ✨ Why This Matters

- **🌐 Universal Access**: DNS works everywhere - no special clients needed
- **🔓 Firewall-Friendly**: DNS port 53 is rarely blocked
- **🎓 Educational**: Demonstrates creative protocol usage
- **🆓 Free to Use**: Powered by OpenRouter's free tier
- **🎪 Just Cool**: Because we can!

## 🚀 Try It Now (60 seconds)

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/duet/llm-over-dns.git
cd llm-over-dns
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Get free API key from https://openrouter.io (takes 30 seconds)
# Add it to .env: OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 3. Run (use port 5353 to avoid sudo)
DNS_PORT=5353 cargo run --release

# 4. Ask AI anything!
dig @localhost -p 5353 'tell me a joke' TXT +short
# "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"

dig @localhost -p 5353 'what is rust' TXT +short
# "Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety..."
```

**That's it!** You're now querying AI through DNS. 🎉

## 💡 How It Works

```
Your Question → DNS Query → LLM over DNS Server → OpenRouter → AI Model → DNS Response
```

1. **You ask**: `dig @localhost 'explain quantum computing' TXT`
2. **DNS receives**: Query with your question
3. **AI answers**: Through OpenRouter's free models
4. **You get**: Response as DNS TXT records

No HTTP. No REST APIs. Just pure DNS magic. ✨

## 🎨 Cool Use Cases

### 1. Command Line AI Assistant
```bash
# Quick facts
dig @localhost 'capital of japan' TXT +short

# Code help
dig @localhost 'rust async await example' TXT +short

# Math
dig @localhost 'what is 15 percent of 80' TXT +short
```

### 2. Network Diagnosis Tool
```bash
# Works even when HTTP is blocked
dig @your-server.com 'debug network issue' TXT

# Firewall-friendly AI access
dig @ai.example.com 'help with ssh connection' TXT
```

### 3. Educational Demo
```bash
# Show students how DNS can do more than just domain names
dig @localhost 'explain dns in simple terms' TXT

# Demonstrate protocol creativity
dig @localhost 'why is this cool' TXT
```

### 4. IoT / Embedded Devices
```bash
# Minimal protocol for resource-constrained devices
# Only DNS client needed - no HTTP libraries
dig @ai-server.local 'sensor reading analysis' TXT
```

### 5. DNS Tunneling (Educational Purpose)
```bash
# Demonstrates data exfiltration techniques
# Useful for security training and CTF challenges
dig @localhost 'explain dns tunneling' TXT
```

## 🎪 The "Built by Claude Code" Story

This entire project was created by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) - Anthropic's AI coding assistant. Every line of code, test, documentation, CI/CD pipeline, Docker configuration, and even this README was written by AI.

### What Claude Code Built:

- ✅ **Core Application**: Async Rust DNS server with LLM integration
- ✅ **100% Test Coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests, mocks
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with multi-platform builds
- ✅ **Docker Support**: Multi-arch images (amd64, arm64)
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete guides, API docs, architecture diagrams
- ✅ **Security**: Vulnerability scanning, audit checks
- ✅ **Release Automation**: Cross-platform binaries for 6 platforms

This showcases what's possible when AI assists in software development - from idea to production in hours, not weeks.

## 🐳 Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Pull and run
docker run -p 5353:53/udp \
  -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here \
  ghcr.io/duyet/llm-over-dns:latest

# Ask AI
dig @localhost -p 5353 'hello world' TXT +short
```

Or use Docker Compose:

```bash
# Create .env with your OPENROUTER_API_KEY
docker-compose up -d

# Query
dig @localhost 'what can you do' TXT +short
```

## 🎮 Fun Examples

```bash
# Get jokes
dig @localhost 'tell me a programming joke' TXT +short

# Quick answers
dig @localhost 'speed of light' TXT +short

# Code snippets
dig @localhost 'python hello world' TXT +short

# Explain concepts
dig @localhost 'explain recursion' TXT +short

# Translation
dig @localhost 'hello in japanese' TXT +short

# Math help
dig @localhost 'pythagorean theorem' TXT +short
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Create `.env` file:

```bash
# Required: Get free API key from https://openrouter.io
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Optional: Choose your AI model (default: nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl:free)
OPENROUTER_MODEL=nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl:free

# Optional: Server settings
DNS_PORT=5353        # Use 5353 to avoid needing sudo
DNS_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0  # Listen on all interfaces
RUST_LOG=info        # Logging level
```

## 🌍 Real-World Deployment

### Free Tier (Perfect for Testing)

Run on any VPS with the free OpenRouter tier:
- No usage limits (fair use applies)
- Fast responses
- Multiple model options

### Production Setup

```bash
# Use Docker for easy deployment
docker run -d \
  --name llm-dns \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 53:53/udp \
  -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=$YOUR_KEY \
  ghcr.io/duyet/llm-over-dns:latest

# Add to your DNS infrastructure
# Point ns.yourdomain.com to your server
# Now queries to ai.yourdomain.com work!
```

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: Is this actually useful?**
A: It's educational, cool, and surprisingly practical in restricted network environments!

**Q: Can I use this in production?**
A: Sure! But consider rate limiting and security implications.

**Q: What if DNS times out?**
A: Increase DNS timeout: `dig +timeout=10 @localhost 'long question' TXT`

**Q: Does this work with any LLM?**
A: Currently OpenRouter only (free tier available). Local LLM support coming soon!

**Q: How fast is it?**
A: Simple queries: 0.5-2s. Complex ones: 2-10s. Depends on model and load.

**Q: Is there a rate limit?**
A: OpenRouter free tier has fair use limits. Plenty for personal use!
